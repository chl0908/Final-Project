# ARRESTS IN 2013
###### BASED ON _AGE, RACE & CRIME_


![jpd](images.png)



Our project's purpose is to provide insight into the
relationship between
_age, race and crime_. The data used
for this project was collected in 2013 by the FBI and published
 by the Uniform Crime Report on their website. The main question we
  are attempting to answer through this app is whether or not a person's race and age
  would affect their likelihood of being arrested. This topic has been a major public
  controversy that has been debated upon for many years.
  The user can view data percentages for criminals from either all ages, those under 18 or those who are 18
  and above through a pie chart and a bubble chart.
  * By choosing the age and race through the radio buttons, users could could get a pie chart that contain the selected information.

  * In the bubble chart, users could get a overall information about the Crime Report. The size of the bubble represents the population of certain race. Users could decide how many bubbles they want to see in the same char by sliding the slider in the sidebar. 


Hopefully, by viewing the data in this app, the user will be
able to conclude about the nature of the relationship between race
and crime. **Have Fun using this APP!**
